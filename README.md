The main character, Lola, has to wander through classrooms and answer questions to proceed to the next room.
All the classrooms are the same, except they slowly deteriorate into a horror-looking room.
It is almost as if the character is going through a nightmare. 
If Lola gets a question right, she proceeds to the next question.
If she gets the question wrong, the nightmare becomes more visible and she will eventually have to run away from a monster in the final level.
